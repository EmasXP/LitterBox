# HIGH

* When navigating to a folder, the view is sometimes scrolled

# MEDIUM

* Filter in "Open with..." dialog
* Application icons in the "Open with" dialog
* "Open with..." "Other application"
  * List all applications that accept a file path, group by category
  * Add option to browse a binary via a file picker
* When renaming file: it would be nice if the file row was still selected after rename

# LOW

* Show "[folder name] [long dash] LitterBox" in the Application title bar
* Cut+Paste: Meta data like created at, modified at, is that copied? If not, shall it be? Same with permissions.
* When deep in tree, the path bar does not fit well
* Close other tabs
* Close tabs to the left/right
* Middle-click to close tabs
* Paste: Folder conflict: "Replace" option. Deletes the target and replaces it with the source. Important to check if Source and Target are the same here.
* Alt+Up/Down to scroll
* Mount and unmount drives
* Network locations
* Share/send to application (like Slack)
* Compress/uncompress
* Rename: Option to choose auto name: "example (1).txt", "example.bak1"
* Ctrl+Shift+PageUp/PageDown to move the current tab
* Paste: Select the pasted file(s) afterwards?
* The "Download" drag-and-drop has an User Agent with version number. Shall we make that dynamic?
* Make sure no #RGB colors are used anywhere. Only theme compatible colors allowed.
* What happens when the current directory is deleted? I guess we shall move the user somewhere?
* Undo Move to Trash?
* Icons in the right-click-menu
* Improvements to Places:
  * Add/edit bookmarks - Maybe there's a standard for this? Qt or KDE/GNOME?
