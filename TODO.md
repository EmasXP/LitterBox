# HIGH

* Right click -> Open with..., has stopped working

# MEDIUM

* The icons are only Folder or File, does not show file type.
* Icons instead of buttons for "New folder" and "New file"
* Padding between the path bar and the separator
* Make the last button in the path bar (the current folder) more distinct. Maybe bold or an alternate background color.
* Drag-and-drop
  * Files to folder
  * LitterBox to external application
  * External application to LitterBox

# LOW

* Show "[folder name] [long dash] LitterBox" in the Application title bar
* More rounding on the path buttons?
* When deep in tree, the path bar does not fit well
* Filter in "Open with..." dialog
* "Open with..." "Other application"
  * List all applications that accept a file path, group by category
  * Add option to browse a binary via a file picker
* When renaming file: it would be nice if the file row was still selected after rename
* The "raw" path bar (the text input one) could be wider
* When opening file, change CWD first
* Feels like our testing structure is wonky, there must be a better way
