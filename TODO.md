# HIGH

_Such empty._

# MEDIUM

* Clicking on folder in the path bar: Pre-select the used-to-be child
* Del to move to trash, Ctrl+Del to delete file. Confirmation first. There can be several items selected too.
* Duplicates in the "Open with" dialog
* Filter in "Open with..." dialog
* Application icons in the "Open with" dialog
* "Open with..." "Other application"
  * List all applications that accept a file path, group by category
  * Add option to browse a binary via a file picker
* When renaming file: it would be nice if the file row was still selected after rename

# LOW

* Show "[folder name] [long dash] LitterBox" in the Application title bar
* Cut+Paste: Meta data like created at, modified at, is that copied? If not, shall it be? Same with permissions.
* When deep in tree, the path bar does not fit well
* The "raw" path bar (the text input one) could be wider
* Some test files are not proper test files, it seems like (at least test_copy_paste.py isn't)
* Feels like our testing structure is wonky, there must be a better way
* Close other tabs
* Close tabs to the left/right
* Middle-click to close tabs
* Paste: Folder conflict: "Replace" option. Deletes the target and replaces it with the source. Important to check if Source and Target are the same here.
* Alt+Up/Down to scroll
* Mount and unmount drives
* Network locations
* Share/send to application (like Slack)
* Compress/uncompress
* Rename: Option to choose auto name: "example (1).txt", "example.bak1"
* Ctrl+Shift+PageUp/PageDown to move the current tab
* Paste: Select the pasted file(s) afterwards?
* The "Download" drag-and-drop has an User Agent with version number. Shall we make that dynamic?
